<h2>This one-pot tomato chicken and white beans dish is reminiscent of Tuscan white beans. Crispy, tender chicken thighs sit on top of creamy white beans and cherry tomatoes in a flavorful white wine sauce.</h2>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
	<li>6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 1/2 pounds)</li>
	<li>3/4 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
	<li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
	<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
	<li>1/3 cup dry white wine or reduced sodium chicken broth</li>
	<li>2 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans, rinsed and drained</li>
	<li>1 pint grape tomatoes</li>
	<li>1/2 cup reduced sodium chicken broth</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano, plus more for garnish</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
	<li>1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
	<li>Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add chicken to skillet. Cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove from skillet.</li>
	<li>Add onion to the skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat until tender, 5 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add garlic to skillet. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
	<li>Pour in wine and stir to break up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Simmer until wine has nearly evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add beans, tomatoes, broth, oregano, crushed red pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt  to the skillet. Bring to a boil. Return chicken to the skillet. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until chicken is done (175 degrees F or 80 degrees C), tomatoes begin to break down, and the bean mixture is creamy, about 20 minutes.</li>
	<li>If desired, lightly mash some of the beans in the skillet to absorb some of the liquid.</li>
	<li>Garnish with Parmesan cheese and additional oregano.</li>
</ol>
